// Implement the Stack and the Queue data structures using a LinkedList
// as their backing data structure.
// Remember: You can't use any arrays to store data! 
// Note: You will need to edit the LinkedList implementation we worked 
// on in class in order to support both stacks and queues. 
// If you get stuck here, remember how stacks and queues function, 
// and what LIFO and FIFO means for the data that they store.
